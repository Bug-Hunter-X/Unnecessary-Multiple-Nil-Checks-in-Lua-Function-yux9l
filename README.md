# Unnecessary Multiple Nil Checks in Lua Function

This example demonstrates a common but easily avoidable coding error in Lua involving multiple `nil` checks. The original `foo` function contains redundant checks for `nil` values.  This can lead to less readable and less efficient code.

The improved version combines these checks, making the code more concise and efficient.
